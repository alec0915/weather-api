# Weather by Alec Whyte

This project has evolved beyond what I thought I could make
It actually works? Like that's crazy to me. I didn't think I could do this.
I had to learn what Flask was and once I got the basics of the app.route decorator worked, I unlocked the ability to just give data to html pages.

I would like to deploy this on GitHub when I feel it's at a stage where I'm happy with it, and I feel like I'm almost there.
