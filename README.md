This project has evolved beyond what I thought I could make.
It actually works? Like that's crazy to me. I didn't think I could do this.
I had to learn what Flask was, and once I got the basics of how the app.route decorator worked, I unlocked the ability to just give data to different html pages.

Apparently I can't use Flask with GitHub pages so I will look elsewhere to put this up.
